Yelp
====
Time Spent: 30+ hours

* Search Results Page
 * Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height - this is not complete
 * Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints - partially complete
 * Search Bar in the navigation bar - implemented


* Filter Page
 * Filters: Sort, Radius, Deals (on/off) - only sort implemented due to time constraints, rest can be completed with additional 3-4 hours of work
 * Categories - not implemented
 * Search from filter page implemented, however Cancel not functioning as expected - will need another hour to fix it.
